This is a work in progress, using viewport industries starkers framework for Wordpress https://github.com/viewportindustries/starkers, and twitter bootstrap http://getbootstrap.com/.

My intention was to create something VERY basic, which could be used for the foundation of a new project. This would include stripping down the css and javascript to it's bare minimum. Most of the extra stuff would need to be added back in, on a per-project basis.
