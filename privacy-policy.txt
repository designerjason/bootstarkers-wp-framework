<p>This page describes how we treat the information provided by visitors, what other information we gather and how we use it, why we sometimes need to store 'cookies' and how to prevent this.</p>

<p>In common with almost all professionally run websites, this website logs the IP address of each visitor in order to keep it running reliably. This is also essential for protecting the website and its visitors from malicious attacks, including infection with malware.</p>

<p>This website provides information as a service to vistors such as yourself, and to do this reliably and efficiently, it sometimes places small amounts of information on your computer or device (e.g. mobile phone). This includes small files known as cookies.</p>

<p>The cookies stored by this website cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>


<h2>How Cookies Are Used</h2>

<p>We sometimes use cookies to remember a choice you make on one page, when you have moved to another page if that information can be used to make the website work better. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>avoiding the need to ask for the same information several times during a session (e.g. when filling in forms), or</li><br />
</ul>

<li>remembering that you have logged in, so that you don’t have to re-enter your username and password on every page.</li>
